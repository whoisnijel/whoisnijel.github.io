        <p>I’m from Cleveland Ohio. I am currently the marketing director at Twin Oaks Media, I oversee all things inbound. I use my problem solving skills on a daily basis creating unique strategies for clients to succeed in their marketing program.
            After graduating from Cleveland State University, I started a small but successful carpet cleaning company, KB Clean. Early on, I learned the difficulties of running a small business in today’s economy. These lessons led me back to my true love of Web design and inbound marketing.</p>
        <h1>WHY A REASON ?</h1>
        <p> Everything happens for a reason. From every experience of your life you will see the shadow can't beat the
        sun, sadness can't beat happiness, anger can't beat smile, frustration can't beat patience, hate can't beat
        love, inhumanity can't beat kindness, failure can't beat success.
